# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
Users were getting logged out after refreshing the page, even though they had valid authentication sessions.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Aggressive Session Cleanup**: The app was clearing authentication data too aggressively on startup
2. **Clock Skew Intolerance**: Minor time differences between client and server caused session invalidation
3. **OAuth State Conflicts**: OAuth flow states were interfering with normal session persistence
4. **Loading Race Conditions**: Auth state wasn't given enough time to initialize properly on page refresh

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AuthContext Improvements (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Better Error Handling**: Modified session initialization to preserve valid sessions even with minor errors
- **Token Refresh Support**: Added proper handling for `TOKEN_REFRESHED` events to maintain user state
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added debug logging for auth state changes
- **OAuth State Management**: Improved OAuth flow completion and cleanup

### 2. Startup Cleanup Optimization (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
- **Less Aggressive Cleanup**: Increased clock skew tolerance from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
- **Selective Token Clearing**: Only remove tokens with significant clock skew, not minor discrepancies
- **Error Handling Refinement**: Better distinction between recoverable and non-recoverable auth errors
- **Session Preservation**: Clear OAuth flags on startup without destroying valid sessions

### 3. App Initialization (`src/App.tsx`)
- **Loading State Enhancement**: Added additional initialization time to ensure auth loads properly
- **Conditional Cleanup**: Only perform cleanup on actual page reloads, not component remounts
- **Performance API Usage**: Use navigation API to detect reload vs navigation

### 4. Browser Compatibility
- **Performance API**: Added fallback for browsers that don't support `performance.navigation`
- **SessionStorage Management**: Proper cleanup of OAuth flow flags

## Testing Instructions

1. **Sign in** to the application using email or Google OAuth
2. **Verify** you can access the dashboard and see your notes
3. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **Confirm** you remain signed in and can access your data
5. **Test OAuth flow** by signing out and signing in again with Google
6. **Refresh during OAuth** to ensure the flow completes properly

## Debug Information

The app now logs auth state changes to the browser console. Look for:
- "Auth state change: SIGNED_IN [email]"
- "Auth state change: TOKEN_REFRESHED [email]"
- "Minor clock skew detected, preserving session"

## Additional Safety Measures

1. **Fallback Recovery**: If auth state is lost, the app gracefully redirects to sign-in
2. **Error Boundaries**: Auth errors are caught and handled without crashing the app
3. **Session Validation**: Proper validation of session data before use
4. **Clock Skew Tolerance**: Up to 30 minutes tolerance for time differences

## Files Modified

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Core authentication logic
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions for auth cleanup and error handling
- `src/App.tsx` - Application initialization and loading states
- `auth-test.html` - Test page for debugging authentication persistence

The fix maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving session persistence across page refreshes and browser restarts.
